* SRNN.py -- Trains a Simple RNN with orthogonal initialisation/penalty on the synthetic problems
* SRNN_MNIST.py -- Trains a Simple RNN with orthogonal initialisation/penalty on the MNIST dataset (sequence of pixes tasks)
* FF_MNIST.py -- Trains a feedforward network with orthogonal initialisation/penalty on the MNIST dataset
